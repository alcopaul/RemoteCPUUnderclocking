Remote CPU Underclocking
------------------------

Visualize A Hypothetical Setup Of The Most Powerful AI Computer Server At The Moment...

And You Can Connect To Its Hardware Via Hocus Pocus And Massively Underclock Each Of Its Stacked Processors...

From 7.5 GHz To 0.0003 GHz...

And It Has 500,000 CPU Cores..

So Each Of The 500,000 CPU Cores That Clocks 7.5 GHz At It's Optimum Drops To 0.0003 GHz...

What Happens To The AI?

Lagged? Garbled? Or Stops?

Visualize Again That At Its Optimum Performance, An AI Interface And Military Equipments Run Ideally In Synced..

Now Dripdrop the AI Interface Via Remote CPU Underclocking...

Nukes Hitting Whatever Targets And Not The Intended Target When Fired..

Like Some National Security Agency Type Of Cyberweapon..

(And It Is Even Alpha Tested In Your Intel Core MKUltra 5 125U Laptop)
